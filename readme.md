# Agentic KYB Evaluation

This repository contains the code and for an evaluation of the KYB AI Agent developed for a fintech company. An agentic system receives KYB documentation and data from customers and returns a decision on their level of risk and required information or documents for enhanced due diligence (EDD). The agentic system is developed using the OpenAI API and the LangChain framework. The evaluation process was conducting used manual and automated methods. First, the agentic responses were analyzed manually by the Compliance team. The output of the AI agent was extracted (from `json` format) and tabulated for presenting to the compliance team. The compliance team then reviewed the output and provided feedback on the accuracy of the agentic system. The feedback was then used to improve the agentic system.
